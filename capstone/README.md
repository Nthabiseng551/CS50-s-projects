#### Distinctiveness and Complexity
#### Description:
I have created a web-based application using Django called "ForMaternity". The aim of which is to provide pregnant women with information and guidence to help them get through pregnancy healthily. The app allows users to track their pregnancy(by indicating how far along they are by updating the weeks depending on the week of pregnancy they provided when they started to track the pregnacy on the app), users (those registered as pregnant) have access to perinatal health information including nutrion, pregnancy weight gain guidelines and are able to track their weight gain journey throughout pregnancy utilising the quidelines and a pregnancy weight gain calculator, in addition, they are able to request a consultation appointment with Dieticians and/or Counsellors (The app allows users to register as Perinatal Dieticians and Counsellors). The users registered as dieticians and counsellors have access to the requests pages for diet-consultation and counselling, respectfully. Another feature is for pregnant women, which includes a checklist of common prenatal tests categorised based on the trimester which they are performed. The first page, Home or index page, renders the index html file which displays the general index information and buttons to register and login if a user is not loged in. If a user is logged in, the general index information is shown, without the login and register buttons) as well as a form to input current week of pregnancy if pregnant, when this form is submitted, the user will be registered as pregnant and the current date of submission is recorded so that the user's week of pregnancy can be automatically updated according to the dates (the index view adds 1 to the recorded week of pregnancy after one week of the date when the user submitted the form, then the date is updated and a week is added after a week of the new date, and so on, until 40 weeks). After the user as registered as pregnant, the index page also displays what week of pregnancy the user is on and how many weeks they have left. The second page, Health html file, includes information on nutrition during pregnancy which also provide a link to an external site, chooseMyplate, which provide advices on nutrition to people in different life stages(the link leads directly to the page for pregnant women on the site). The second item on the Health page is the Weight Management which includes pregnancy weight gain guidelines and a link to track weight, which when clicked on, a weight html file is rendered. The weight page displays a "pregnancy weight gain calculator" button that tates the user to an external site when clicked on, this tool helps pregnant users to determine their target total weight the should gain during pregnancy, depending on BMI. Once the user have the target total weight, they can use the form displayed on the weight page to track their weight gain progress. The form has three inputs fiels, for current weight(which must be provided on a regular basis everytime the user tracks their weight progress), the other two fiels are for Pre-pregnancy weight and the target total weight determined by the pregnancy weight gain calculator (these two field may only be submitted unless the user realises there is a need for rectification). When the weight information is provided, the weight page displays, on top, a comparison of the 'current weight gain of total target weight' progress to the percentage of how far along a user is with pregnancy. The system determines the difference between the two percentage values and, using Javascript, if the difference is then the user is alerted that their weight gain progress is in a safe regime
