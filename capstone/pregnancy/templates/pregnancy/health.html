<div class="panel">
  <p>When you're pregnant, you need more of certain nutrients â€” like protein, iron, folic acid, iodine, and choline. You also need more calories and must ensure that you get enough calcium, vitamin D, potassium, and fiber. Smart food choices combined with regular physical fitness and adequate fluid intake are essential for a healthy pregnancy and healthy baby.</p>

<button class="accordion">Weight management</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Most women should gain somewhere between 25 and 35 pounds (11.5 to 16 kilograms) during pregnancy. Most will gain 2 to 4 pounds (1 to 2 kilograms) during the first trimester, and then 1 pound (0.5 kilogram) a week for the rest of the pregnancy. The amount of weight gain depends on your situation.
<ul>
    <li>Overweight women need to gain less (10 to 25 pounds or 4 to 11 kilograms or less, depending on their pre-pregnancy weight).</li>
    <li>Underweight women will need to gain more (28 to 40 pounds or 13 to 18 kilograms).</li>
    <li>You should gain more weight if you are having more than 1 baby. Women having twins need to gain 37 to 54 pounds (16.5 to 24.5 kilograms).</li>
</ul></p>

<div class="panel">
    <p>Perinatal mental health issues can cause significant complications during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The mental health disorders include depression, anxiety disorders, and postpartum psychosis, which usually manifests as bipolar disorder. Perinatal psychiatric disorders impair a woman's function and are associated with suboptimal development of her offspring. Factors that increase the likelihood of developing a perinatal mental health issue include:
        <ul></ul>
        <p>As well as psychosocial risk factors:
            <ul></ul>
        </p>Risk factors include past history of depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder, as well psychosocial factors, such as ongoing conflict with the partner, poor social support, and ongoing stressful life events. Early symptoms of depression, anxiety, and mania can be detected through screening in pregnancy and the postpartum period. Early detection and effective management of perinatal psychiatric disorders are critical for the welfare of women and their offspring.</p>
