# Mental Health Friendly
#### Video Demo: <URL>
#### Description:
I have created a web-based application using flask that serves as a community for people dealing with mental health issues. The website allows for users to take psychological tests (which were obtained from an external website),it also allows for users to post and view stories addressing mental health issues, also users with acceptable background can volunteer as counsellors and requests for counselling are also lodged on the website. There are four webpages; the index/homepage, psychological tests, surviving and counselling. On the index page (index.html), the purpose of the website is briefed and there are two buttons, one to register and the other to login. If a user is logged in, the index page greets the user using their username and the register and login button are not displayed anymore, the remaining three pages (psychological tests, surviving and counselling) requires that a user is logged in to gain access to the pages.
